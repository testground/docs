# Test plans and test cases

## What is a test plan?

A test plan is a collection of test cases that exercise, benchmark, or verify a particular component, subsystem, or API of the system under test.

**Test plans are the unit of deployment that Testground deals with.**

Each test plan is a world of its own. In other words, test plans are _opaque_ to Testground: they behave like black boxes.

> Testground does not care what the test plan actually does, the language it's written in, nor the runtime it targets. As long as the source code is accessible, and a builder exists to compile that code into a runnable artifact, such as an executable or a Docker image, you're good to go ðŸš€
>
> At the time of writing, Testground offers two builders:
>
> * **`exec:go`** compiles a Go test plan into a platform executable using the system Go installation.
> * **`docker:go`** compiles a Go test plan into a Docker image.

## The test plan &lt;&gt; Testground contract

While test plans are opaque to the eyes of Testground, test plans and Testground promise to satisfy a contract. That contract is inspired by the [12-factor principles](https://12factor.net/), and facilitates deployment on cloud infrastructure when it's time to scale. The contract is as follows:

1. **Execution:** Test plans expose a single point of entry, i.e. a `main()` function.
2. **Input:** Test plans consume a [formal, standardized runtime environment](runtime.md), in the form of environment variables.
3. **Output:** Test plans record events, results, and optional diagnostics in a predefined JSON schema on stdout and specific files. Any additional output assets they want harvested \(e.g. event trails, traces, generated files, etc.\) are written to a path received in the runtime environment.

?> **Success** The Testground community offers SDKs that make it easy for user-written test plans to adhere to the test plan contract, as well as facilitating interactions with the sync service and the emission of metrics.

## Test plan manifest

Every test plan must contain a `manifest.toml` file at its root. This is a specification file that declares:

* the name of the test plan, and authorship metadata.
* which builders and runners it can work with.
* the test cases it contains.
* for each test case, the parameters it accepts, including the data type, default value, and a description.

The `manifest.toml` is used by tools such as the **Testground CLI,** or the upcoming Jupyter Notebooks integration, to enable a better user experience.  Without this manifest file, it would be impossible to know the contents and behaviour of a test plan without inspecting its source.

For more information on the format of the manifest, see [Writing test plans &gt; Test plan manifest](../writing-test-plans/test-plan-manifest.md).

## Where do test plans live?

Test plans can be hosted and version anywhereâ€”either on the local filesystem, or on public or private Git repositories: Testground does not care.

What's important is that **the test plans source is available to the Testground client during runtime**, under the `$TESTGROUND_HOME/plans` directory, where `$TESTGROUND_HOME` defaults to `$HOME/testground` if not set.

!> Please note that `$TESTGROUND_HOME`is not the same place where you clone the Testground [git repository](https://github.com/testground/testground).

The Testground client CLI offers a series of simple commands to manage test plan sources. Refer to the [Managing test plans](managing-test-plans.md) section for more information.

## Test cases

While the unit of deployment in Testground is the test plan, **test plans nest** _**one or many test cases**_ **inside.**

Think of a test plan as a family of tests that, together, exercises a given component or subsystem. Test cases evaluate concrete use cases that we wish to reproduce consistently, in order to capture variations in the observed behaviour, as the source code of the relevant components evolve over time.

Testground offers first-class support for dealing with test cases inside test plans:

1. When inspecting a test plan, the Testground CLI allows you to enumerate all test cases within all test plans:

   ```bash
   $ testground plan list --testcases
   ```

2. When scheduling a test run, the Testground CLI allows you to specify the test case out of a test plan that you want to run, e.g.:

   ```bash
   $ testground run single \
                    --plan=network \
                    --testcase=ping-pong \
                    --builder=docker:go \
                    --runner=local:docker \
                    --instances=2 \
                    --wait
   ```

3. When developing a test plan, the Testground SDK allows you to select the test case that will run, based on an environment variable.

## Test runs

Every time we execute a test plan, we generate a test run. Each test run is assigned a unique ID. That ID is used to identify the run when collecting outputs, or exploring results or diagnostics.
