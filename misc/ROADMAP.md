# Testground Roadmap

## **DISCLAIMER:** This Roadmap is still very much WIP. For a `"State of Testground Update"` and `"Functional Roadmap"`, consult [`State of Testground - Mid Q4 2019 (Team Only)`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpifz6CSEYhas1a3ZpgCcDWAFl9Ysmr7o_JH0n8Vny0/edit#heading=h.8djx5icip69b). The primary milestone for the [`Testground MVP is to Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0`](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196)

# Q4 2019

## ðŸš€ Major Goals to Achieve

- Test Ground is Operational
- go-ipfs is unblocked for its next minor release (0.5.0)

## ðŸ’Ž Milestones

#### A formal specification is created of how to create a Test Plan

We have a format to spec out Test Plans and we've spec'ed out at least 10 Test Plans. These 10 Test Plans should directly contribute to increase the degree of confidence when shipping a go-ipfs Release 

#### Testground can leverage the Cloud to run its tests

- Testground can run on Cloud Infrastructure as well as in local environment
- A dashboard exists to visualize the result of the tests

#### Testground can simulate network conditions

For example: 
- bottlenecks (networks with different bandwidth)
- network isolation (i.e. NATs)

#### We bring up the total team capacity to 3 full time people

We started the quarter at 1 + 0.3 + 0.5
